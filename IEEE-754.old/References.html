    <h2 id="history">History of the Calculators</h2>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <p>These calculators came into being in the fall semester of 1997 when
      I assigned my Computer Organization course an optional project to
      write a program that would print the values of the fields of IEEE-754
      floating point numbers.  One student, Quanfei Wen, decided to do the
      program as an interactive web page, using Javascript to do the
      calculations.</p>

      <p>I put Quanfei&rsquo;s pages up on my web site as a resource for other
      students taking my Computer Organization course, where it was found by
      Keven Brewer, who was working for Delco Electronics at the time.
      Kevin noticed some special cases that Quanfei&rsquo;s calculators didn&rsquo;t
      handle, and volunteered to work up the precise versions of the code
      that the calculators now use.  Kevin also did a web search for
      information on the IEEE-754 standard, which is included in the <a
      href="#report">Kevin&rsquo;s Report</a> section below.  Kevin also prepared
      some <a href="#tables">web tables</a> listing the parameters of the
      standard.</p>

      <p>The calculators have turned out to be a popular resource on the web
      for academics and industry alike.  I know of translations into <a
      href="http://www.zator.com/Cpp/E2_2_4a.htm">Spanish</a> and <a
      href="http://www.telecom.fh-htwchur.ch/~zogg/">German</a>, and they
      get over 10,000 hits a month on my web server.</p>

      <p>In December 2004 I started reworking these pages to improve their
      appearance and conformance to web standards.  The javascript code
      behind them has been moved to separate files, but interested users can
      download the code from the <a href="js">js/ directory</a>.  The
      original pages, with embedded javascript code, remain available at my
      old Computer Organization <a
      href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/IEEE-754.html">course web
      site</a>.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;In 1976 Intel began to design a floating-point co-processor for
      its i8086/8 and i432 microprocessors. Dr. John Palmer persuaded Intel
      that it needed an arithmetic standard to prevent different boxes with
      &ldquo;Intel&rdquo; on the outside from computing disparate results inside. At
      Stanford ten years earlier, Palmer had heard a visiting professor,
      William Kahan, analyze commercially significant arithmetics and assess
      how much their anomalies inflated the costs of reliable and portable
      numerical software. Kahan had also enhanced the numerical prowess of a
      successful line of Hewlett-Packard calculators. Palmer, now the
      manager of Intel&rsquo;s floating-point effort, recruited Kahan as a
      consultant to help design the arithmetic for the i432 ( which died
      later ) and for the i8086/8&rsquo;s upcoming i8087 coprocessor.&rdquo; From <a
      href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.html">An
      Interview with the Old Man of Floating-Point</a>, a short, facinating
      read on the development of the IEEE-754 Floating-Point standard.</p>


      <p><i>The IEEE-754 Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic</i>
      was published in 1985.  You can order a copy of the standard from <a
      href="http://standards.ieee.org/">the
      IEEE</a>.  The web site for the IEEE-754 is a good place to go for
      links to information about IEEE-754 and floating-point in general.</p>

      <p>A popular paper on the mathematical properties of floating-point
      numbers, including the IEEE-754 standard is <a
      href="http://www.validlab.com/goldberg/paper.pdf">What Every
      Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic</a>,
      which is also available from <a
      href="http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/800-7895">docs.sun.com</a></p>

      <p>
        The Q4, 1999 issue of the Intel Technology Journal had an article, <i><a
        href="http://download.intel.com/technology/itj/q41999/pdf/ia64fpbf.pdf"> IA-64 Floating-Point operations and the
        IEEE standard for binary floating-point arithmetic,</a></i> by M. Cornea-Hasegan and B. Norin, which provides a
        summary of the IEEE-754 standard and includes a table of ten different floating-point formats used by
        Intel&rsquo;s 64-bit microprocessors (the IA-64 architecture).  Most of the article discusses featues of the
        IA-64 floating-point instruction set. [2008-11-14: Link updated to point to PDF version of the article.]
      </p>

      <p>
        A significant floating-point standard, which pre-dates the IEEE-754 standard, is the &ldquo;hexadecimal
        encoding&rdquo; used on IBM mainframes.  This  format uses sixteen instead of two as the base to which the
        exponent is raised. The IBM S/390 G5 processor was the first one to integrate IBM&rsquo;s traditional
        hexadecimal encoding and IEEE-754 in the same floating-point unit. It is described in the paper, <a
        href="http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/435/schwarz.html"> <i>The S/390 G5 floating point unit</i></a> by
        E.  M. Schwarz and C. A.  Krygowski, which appeared in the IBM Journal of Research and Development, vol. 43, No.
        5/6, September/November 1999, pp 707-721.

        special number, Indeterminate, was [&nbsp;<a href="http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html">this
        page</a>&nbsp;] (<span class="updateNote">link updated 2007-10-13</span>).  To find the table showing these NaNs
        and Indeterminate, use the Edit | Find...  command on the string &ldquo;the corresponding values&rdquo;.  Scroll
        up a little in order to take a look at the &ldquo;Special Operations&rdquo; table.  And right above that table
        is the list of special numbers and their meanings.</p>

        <p>The source which introduced me to the concepts of &ldquo;signaling&rdquo; and &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; NaNs was
        [&nbsp;http://www.cas.american.edu/~studdard/classes/fall1995/4028201/notes/17oct95/I.html&nbsp;].  To find the
        section on &ldquo;signaling&rdquo; and &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; NaNs, use the Edit | Find... command on the string
        &ldquo;NaNs can be signaling or quiet&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>The source which allowed me to distinguish between &ldquo;signaling&rdquo; and &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; NaNs was
        [&nbsp;<a href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1832.html">this page</a>&nbsp;].  To find the section on
        NaNs and the encodings of other special numbers, use the Edit | Find... command on the string &ldquo;The
        definition of NaNs&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>[&nbsp;<a href="http://www.psc.edu/general/software/packages/ieee/ieee.html">This source</a>&nbsp;] shows the
        mathematical equations which define the various IEEE-754 values and ranges.</p>

        <p>The source which introduced me to IEEE-754&rsquo;s four rounding modes and the guard, round, and
        &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; bits was [&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~weems/CmpSci535/535lecture6.html">this
        page</a>&nbsp;].  To find the section on rounding, use the Edit | Find...  command on the string &ldquo;four
        different rounding modes&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>Some sources on the Web claim that IEEE-754 specifies four floating-point formats in two groups, basic and
        extended, with a &ldquo;single-precision&rdquo; and a &ldquo;double-precision&rdquo; format in each of the two
        groups.  To find this information, use the Edit | Find...  command on the string &ldquo;IEEE 754 specifies
        four&rdquo; on [&nbsp;http://www.cas.american.edu/~studdard/classes/fall1995/4028201/notes/17oct95/I.html&nbsp;]
        and the Edit | Find... command on the string &ldquo;The other two formats&rdquo; on [&nbsp;<a
        href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/~weems/CmpSci535/535lecture6.html">this page</a>&nbsp;].</p>

        <p>Upon reading the IEEE-754 standard, one learns from &ldquo;Table 1, Summary of Format Parameters&rdquo; on
        page 9 that the extended formats are very loosely defined with unspecified exponential biases and only lower
        bounds for precisions and exponents, while the basic formats are specified exactly in terms of field widths and
        semantics.  The extended formats are so loosely defined that particular implementations of these formats may be
        so different that numerical approximation routines using them could be non-portable.</p>

        <p>Other sources on the Web claim that IEEE-754 specifies only three floating-point formats,
        &ldquo;single-precision&rdquo;, &ldquo;double-precision&rdquo;, and &ldquo;quadruple-precision&rdquo;.  <!--
        change http://www.iac.tut.fi/usr/local/doc/Fortran-90/Version-2.0/f9a200_spd.txt to

        href="http://www.iac.tut.fi/usr/local/doc/Fortran-90/Version-2.0/f9a200_spd.txt">&nbsp;] shows the three
        IEEE-754 formats and their max and min values in DEC&rsquo;s Fortran-90 documentation.  To find the section on
        the three IEEE-754 formats, use the Edit | Find... command on the string &ldquo;32-bit IEEE&rdquo;.  [&nbsp;<a
        href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc1832.html">Another source</a>&nbsp;] shows the encodings of the
        special numbers and the number of bits in each field for each of the three IEEE-754 formats.  To find the
        sections on the three IEEE-754 formats, use the Edit | Find... command on the string &ldquo;For single-precision
        floating point numbers&rdquo; and start scrolling down.</p>

        <p>When comparing the format parameters of &ldquo;extended double-precision&rdquo; in IEEE-754&rsquo;s Table 1
        and those of the so-called &ldquo;quadruple-precision&rdquo;, one finds that the
        &ldquo;quadruple-precision&rdquo; format is simply a specific instance of the &ldquo;extended
        double-precision&rdquo; format.  Similarly, one will note that &ldquo;double-precision&rdquo; is a specific
        instance of &ldquo;extended single-precision&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>The 80-bit &ldquo;extended-precision&rdquo; format is used &ldquo;internally&rdquo; by the Intel 80x87
        floating-point math &ldquo;co-processor&rdquo; in order to be able to shift operands back and forth without any
        loss of precision in the IEEE-754 64-bit (and 32-bit) format.  To find this information, use the Edit | Find...
        command on the string &ldquo;it also implements an &ldquo;extended-precision&rdquo; format&rdquo; on

        <p>A source which describes the exponential bias of Intel&rsquo;s 80-bit &ldquo;extended-precision&rdquo; format
        and its usage of the additional bits it contains relative to the &ldquo;double-precision&rdquo; format is
        [&nbsp;<a href="http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/AoA/DOS/ch14/CH14-1.html#HEADING1-52">webster.cs.ucr.edu</a>&nbsp;].
        (<span class="updateNote">Link updated 2005-05-03</span>). To find this data, use the Edit | Find...  command on
        the string &ldquo;In order to help ensure accuracy&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>[&nbsp;http://webster.cs.ucr.edu/Page_asm/ArtofAssembly/CH14/CH14-3.html&nbsp;] states that Intel&rsquo;s
        &ldquo;extended-precision&rdquo; format supports non-normalized numbers (values very close to zero whose most
            significant mantissa bit is not zero).  To find this support information, use the Edit | Find... command on
        the string &ldquo;Normalized values provide&rdquo;.</p>

        <p>When one compares these stated and implied format parameters of Intel&rsquo;s
        &ldquo;extended-precision&rdquo; with those of &ldquo;extended double-precision&rdquo; in Table&nbsp;1, one
        finds that the &ldquo;extended-precision&rdquo; format is a specific instance of the &ldquo;extended
        double-precision&rdquo; format, similarly to the &ldquo;quadruple-precision&rdquo; format.</p>

      <h3>Storage Layout and Ranges of Floating-Point Numbers</h3>

        <p>IEEE-754 floating-point numbers require three component fields: the sign,
        the exponent, and the mantissa.  The exponential base is 2 and is never stored
        in any way with the value in either the registers or memory (it is implied).
        In order to allow the exponent and mantissa, when taken together, to vary
        monotonically, the signed exponent is represented in excess-127 unsigned form
        for single precision and excess-1023 for double precision.  This excess-127
        (or excess-1023) representation is indicated by the variable
        &ldquo;<i>e</i>&rdquo; below.</p>

        <p>Since IEEE-754 floating-point numbers are stored in a <i>signed
        magnitude</i> form, the ranges and binary patterns of the positive and
        negative numbers are symmetric about the midpoint of the entire range
        of values (between the positive and negative zeros).  As a result,
        essentially any statement made in regard to the positive numbers is
        also true of the negative numbers and vice versa.</p>

        <p>The range of positive floating-point numbers is split into
        <i>normalized</i> numbers (<i>normal</i> numbers) which preserve the
        full precision of the mantissa, including the hidden bit, (24 bits for
        single precision and 53 bits for double precision) and
        <i>denormalized</i> numbers (<i>subnormal</i> numbers, so-called
        unnormalized numbers) which have from 1 to 23 significant bits for
        single precision and 1 to 52 bits for double precision.</p>

        <p>The number line tables below, which show the layout for single (32-bit) and
        double (64-bit) precision floating-point numbers and their special values,
        were inspired by the table on [&nbsp;<a
        href="http://steve.hollasch.net/cgindex/coding/ieeefloat.html">this
        page</a>&nbsp;] (<span class="updateNote">link updated 2007-10-13</span>).  To find the table on which these
        two are based, use the Edit | Find... command on the string &ldquo;the
        corresponding values&rdquo;.  In their column headers, these tables indicate
        the number of bits in each field along with their bit ranges in square
        brackets.</p>

        <p>The values shown in the <b>Decimal Range</b> column of the tables
        are the end points of their respective ranges with the IEEE-754
        round-to-nearest value mode applied.  JavaScript uses IEEE-754 double
        precision floating-point with round-to-nearest value mode to perform
        all of its arithmetic operations including its input string to numeric
        conversion routine.  Therefore, by default, double (64-bit) precision
        conversions are automatically rounded to values matching these
        tables.  In order for single (32-bit) precision conversions to be
        rounded to values matching these tables, the user <i>must</i> click
        the <b>Rounded</b> button on those pages where it is present.</p>

        <p><sup>&sect;&nbsp;</sup>Your least significant digits may

        <p><sup>*&nbsp;</sup>The minimum magnitude values of denormalized
        ranges are represented by a single significant bit (a bit whose value
        is 1) at the right hand end of its format&rsquo;s mantissa.  For single
        (32-bit) and double (64-bit) precision, these minimum range values are
        1.4012984643248170E-45 and 4.9406564584124654E-324 respectively.  The
        values 7.0064923216240862E-46 and 2.4703282292062328E-324 are each a
        little more than half of these minima. They are represented by one
        significant bit to the right of their format&rsquo;s storable mantissa and
        another 1-bit spaced the double precision&rsquo;s mantissa width to the
        right of the first bit.  Then, as a result of the IEEE-754
        round-to-nearest value mode&rsquo;s operation, these values are rounded to
        the denormalized range minimum values.</p>
